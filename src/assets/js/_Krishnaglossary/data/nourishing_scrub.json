        "desc": "The fruit pulp dries on the tree inside the hard fruit pod to form a cream colored chalky chunk around each seed. The pulp is ground into a dry mealy powder and separated from the red fibers and the seeds. The powder is about 79% water soluble and contains significant levels of ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Significant components are polysaccharides (complex sugars), and alpha hydroxyl acids including tartaric acid and polyphenols. The astringent effect of the tartaric acid helps to tighten and firm up tissue. The sugars form a moisturizing complex which holds water in the skin and gives the skin a smoother appearance.",
